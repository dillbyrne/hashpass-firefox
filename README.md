#Hashpass
Makes it easy to use hashes as passwords. Supported hashes (md5,sha1,sha256,sha512). There is an accompanying android app which does the same in F-Droid

### Features

* Option to reveal or hide text entry
* Option to show or hide resulting hash
* Hotkey to quickly bring up panel `Ctrl` + `;`
* Context menu item to insert hash directly into password fields (avoiding the clipboard)
* Option to copy to clipboard if it is desired (e.g for a program outside the browser)
* Hash and text fields are cleared after inserting via the menu item or after copying to the clipboard.

Note : If you use the clipboard method be sure to clear it after you paste it. A quick way to do this is to select the copy option again as it will now be empty
